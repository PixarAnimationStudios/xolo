    Uninstall a title, if possible. Not all titles are uninstallable via xolo.

  update, U
    Run any pending updates to currently installed titles, or install new titles

    and the title's configuration. This also happens automatically every time

    Note: this just runs the 'jamf policy' command, which will execute any pending
    Jamf policies triggered by "recurring check-in".

    Update xolo's information about current titles and versions.
    This also happens automatically at least daily, when this computer is online.

  details, d <title> [<version>]
    Show detailed information about a title, or a specific version thereof.
