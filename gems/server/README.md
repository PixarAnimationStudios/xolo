# Xolo - CLI and Automated Package and Patch Management for Jamf Pro

The xolo-server gem packages the code needed to run `xoloserver`, a sinatra-based HTTPS server that is the heart of Xolo [link to come], a command-line based system for automation and standardization around software deployment and management via Jamf Pro and the Jamf Title Editor.

The xolo server provides the interface between the admin tool `xadm` and the Jamf Pro and Jamf Title Editor APIs.

More documentation coming soon.
