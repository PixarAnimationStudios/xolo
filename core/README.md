# Xolo - CLI and Automated Package and Patch Management for Jamf Pro

The xolo-core code provides the core functionality for all parts of Xolo [link to come], a command-line based system for automation and standardization around software deployment and management via Jamf Pro and the Jamf Title Editor.

This code is added to the server and admin gems when they are built. At this point it is intentionally not a separate gem.

More documentation to come.
