# d3 - Command line package and patch management for Jamf Pro

d3 (a.k.a. depot3) is a package deployment and patch management system for OS X that enhances
[Jamf Pro](https://www.jamf.com/products/jamf-pro/), an enterprise-level management system for Apple devices. It was created by [Pixar Animation Studios](http://www.pixar.com/).


d3 adds these capabilities and more to Jamf Pro's package handling:

* Automatic software updates on clients when new versions are released on the server
* Pre-release piloting of new packages
* Customizable slideshow presented during logout/reboot installs
* Installs and uninstalls are conditional on the exit status of pre-flight scripts
* Packages can be expired (auto-uninstalled) after a period of disuse
* Both the client and admin tools are command-line only and fully scriptable
* Admin command-line options allow integration with developer workflows and package-retrieval tools

d3 is written in Ruby and available as a rubygem called ['depot3'](https://rubygems.org/gems/depot3). It interfaces with Jamf Pro via its REST API using [ruby-jss](https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/ruby-jss), a ruby module that provides simple and powerful access to the API. It also uses Jamf Pro's backend MySQL database directly to provide enhanced features.

## DOCUMENTATION

Full user/administrator documentation is available at the [GitHub project's wiki page](https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/depot3/wiki).

The developer documentation for the D3 ruby module is at [http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/depot3](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/depot3).

Also check out [ruby-jss](https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/ruby-jss), which is used by d3, but is useful for working with the Jamf Pro REST API in any project.
