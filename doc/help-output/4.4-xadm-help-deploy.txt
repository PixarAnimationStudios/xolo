Command:
  deploy, Use MDM to deploy a version of a title on one or more computers or computer groups.

Description:
  An MDM 'InstallEnterpriseApplication' command will be sent to the target computers to
  install the version. If the version is already installed, it will be updated.
  Computers in any excluded-groups for the target will be removed from the list of targets before
  the MDM command is sent.
  
  Computers can be specified by name, serial number, or Jamf ID. Groups can be specified by name or ID.
  
  The package for the version must be a signed 'Product Archive', like those built with
  'productbuild', not a 'component package', as is generated by 'pkgbuild'.
  When you upload the .pkg to Xolo, it will automatically get a basic manifest needed for the
  MDM command.

Usage:
  xadm deploy title version [computer ...] [options]

Arguments:
  title:     The unique name of a title in Xolo, e.g. 'google-chrome'
  version:   The version of the title you are working with. e.g. '12.34.5'

Options:
  -g, --groups=<s>    One or more Jamf Computer Group names or ids whose members will receive the MDM deployment.
                      
                      When using the --groups CLI option, you can specify more than one group by using the option more than
                      once, or by providing a single option value with the groups separated by commas.
