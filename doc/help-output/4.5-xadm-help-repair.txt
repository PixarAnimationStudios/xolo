Command:
  repair, Ensure all Title Editor and Jamf Objects exist and are correctly configured

Description:
  For each title and version in Xolo, there are many objects in the Title Editor and Jamf Pro,
  including patch definitions, criteria, policies, patch policies, computer groups, extension attributes and so on.

  Normally these are created, updated, and deleted as needed by the Xolo server. However,
  sometimes things can get out-of-whack.

  This process will ensure the necessary Title Editor and Jamf Pro objects exist and have the
  correct settings for the given title or version.

  When specifying only a title, just the objects related to the title are repaired, not its versions.
  If you want to repair all the versions as well, use the --versions option.

  When specifying a title and a version, only that version is repaired.

Usage:
  xadm repair title [version] [options]

Arguments:
  title:     The unique name of a title in Xolo, e.g. 'google-chrome'
  version:   The version of the title you are working with. e.g. '12.34.5'

Options:
  -v, --versions    When repairing a title, also repair all of its versions.

  -h, --help        Show this message
