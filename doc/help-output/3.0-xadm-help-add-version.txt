Command:
  add-version, Add a new version to a title, making it available for piloting

Description:
  The version will be automatically installed or updated on any computers
  in the 'pilot-groups' defined for the version. To manually install it
  on other computers, you must use 'xolo install <title> <version>'.

Usage:
  xadm add-version title version [options]

Arguments:
  title:     The unique name of a title in Xolo, e.g. 'google-chrome'
  version:   The version of the title you are working with. e.g. '12.34.5'

Options:
  -d, --publish-date=<s>     The date this version was released by the publisher.
                             Default is today.

  -o, --min-os=<s>           The lowest version of macOS able to run this version of this title.

  -O, --max-os=<s>           The highest version of macOS able to run this version of this title.

  -r, --reboot               The installation of this version requires the computer to reboot. Users will be notified before
                             installation.

  -s, --standalone           The installer for this version is a full installer, not an incremental patch that must be installed on
                             top of an earlier version.

  -k, --killapps=<s>         A killapp is an application that cannot be running while this version is installed.
                             If running, installation is delayed, and users are notified to quit.

                             Killapps are defined by an app name e.g. 'Google Chrome.app', and the app's Bundle ID
                             e.g. 'com.google.chrome'.

                             Specify them together separated by a semi-colon, e.g.
                                'Google Chrome.app;com.google.chrome'

                             If the title for this version has a defined --app-name and --app-bundle-id, you can
                             use them as a killapp by specifying 'use-title'

                             If not using --walkthru you can use --killapps multiple times

  -p, --pilot-groups=<s>     One or more Jamf Computer Groups whose members will automatically have this version installed or
                             updated for testing before it is released.

                             These computers will be used for testing not just the software, but the installation process itself.
                             Exclusions win, so computers that are also in an excluded group for the title will not be used as
                             pilots.

                             When this version is released, the computers in the release_groups defined in the title will
                             automatically have this version installed - and any computers with an older version will have it
                             updated.

                             When using the --pilot-groups CLI option, you can specify more than one group by using the option more
                             than once, or by providing a single option value with the groups separated by commas.

                             When adding a new version, the pilot groups from the previous version will be inherited if you don't
                             specify any. To make the new version have no pilot groups use 'none'.

                             NOTE: Any non-excluded computer can be used for piloting at any time by manually installing the
                             yet-to-be-released version using `sudo xolo install <title> <version>`.  The members of the pilot
                             groups are just the ones that will have it auto-installed.

  -u, --pkg-to-upload=<s>    The path to a local copy of the installer package for this version. Will be uploaded to Xolo and then
                             Jamf Pro, distribution point(s), replacing any previously uploaded.

                             Must be a flat .pkg file, or a .zip compressed old-style bundle package.

                             It will be renamed to 'xolo-<title>-<version>.pkg' (or .zip).
                             If your Xolo server is confiured to sign unsigned packages, it will do so along the way.
                             REQUIRED
