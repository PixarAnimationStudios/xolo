Command:
  save-client, Save the xolo client tool to a directory for packaging and deployment.

Description:
  Saves the 'xolo' client tool to the specified directory. If no
  directory is given, saves to /tmp/. The version saved is the same
  version as the xadm tool you are running.

  Once saved, you can package and deploy the client tool to your
  managed Macs in whatever way is appropriate for your environment.

  'xolo' is a command-line tool for installing and otherwise working
  with xolo-managed software on Macs. It is a single-file zsh script.
  Fundamentally, it is a wrapper around the 'jamf policy' command,
  but it also provides additional functionality.
  See 'xolo help' for details.

Usage:
  xadm save-client [/path/to/dir]
