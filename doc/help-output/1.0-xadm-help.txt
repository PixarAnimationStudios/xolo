Name:
  xadm, A command-line tool for managing Software Titles and Versions in Xolo.

Usage:
  xadm [global-options] command [target] [command-options]

Global Options:
  -v, --version         Print version and exit

  -h, --help            Show this help and exit

  -w, --walkthru        Run xadm in interactive mode when adding or editing titles or versions.
                        This causes xadm to present an interactive, menu-and-
                        prompt-driven interface. All command-options given on the
                        command line are ignored, and will be gathered
                        interactively.
                        The 'config' command is always interactive, even without --walkthru.

  -a, --auto-confirm    Do not ask for confirmation before making changes or using server-
                        admin commands.
                        This is mostly used for automating xadm.
                        Ignored if using --walkthru: if you're interacive you must confirm
                        your changes.
                        WARNING: Be careful that all values are correct.

  -q, --quiet           Run xadm in quiet mode
                        When used with add-, edit-, delete-, and release-
                        commands, nothing will be printed to standard output.

                        Ignored for other commands, the purpose of which is to print
                        something to standard output.
                        Also ignored if --debug is given

                        WARNING: For long-running processes, you may not see server errors!

  -j, --json            For commands that output lists or info about titles and versions,
                        such as 'list-titles' or 'info <title> <version>',
                        return the data as raw JSON.

  -d, --debug           Run xadm in debug mode
                        This causes more verbose output and full backtraces
                        to be printed on errors. Overrides --quiet
