        # This is how we 'mix in' modules to Sinatra servers
        # for route definitions and similar things
        #
        # (things to be 'included' for use in route and view processing
        # are mixed in by delcaring them to be helpers)
        #
        # We make them extentions here with
        #    extend Sinatra::Extension (from sinatra-contrib)
        # and then 'register' them in the server with
        #    register Xolo::Server::<Module>
        # Doing it this way allows us to split the code into a logical
        # file structure, without re-opening the Sinatra::Base server app,
        # and let xeitwork do the requiring of those files
        extend Sinatra::Extension
